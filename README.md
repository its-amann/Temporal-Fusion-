# Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) for Time Series Forecasting

## Project Overview

This project implements the **Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)** for time series forecasting, focusing on hourly electricity prices for France (FR) and Belgium (BE). The goal is to create a robust, accurate forecasting model by leveraging multiple data series. The project includes data preparation, feature engineering, model training, parameter tuning, and implementation for reliable forecasts that support decision-making processes.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf, plot_pacf
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose
from sklearn.model_selection import ParameterGrid
from sklearn.metrics import (mean_absolute_error, 
                             mean_squared_error, 
                             mean_absolute_percentage_error)

### **Load Data**
```python
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")
```

### **Data Preprocessing**
```python
# Preprocess the data (example)
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'])
data.set_index('Date', inplace=True)
```

## **4. Model Building**

### **Model Initialization**
```python
model = TFTModel(
    input_chunk_length=30,
    output_chunk_length=7,
    hidden_size=32,
    lstm_layers=2,
    num_attention_heads=4,
    dropout=0.1,
    batch_size=16,
    n_epochs=100,
)
```

### **Model Training**
```python
train, val = TimeSeries.split(data, 0.8)
model.fit(train)
```

---

## **5. Evaluation**

### **Model Predictions**
```python
forecast = model.predict(n=30, series=train)
```

### **Performance Metrics**
```python
mae = mean_absolute_error(val, forecast)
mse = mean_squared_error(val, forecast)
mape = mean_absolute_percentage_error(val, forecast)

print(f"MAE: {mae}, MSE: {mse}, MAPE: {mape}%")
```
